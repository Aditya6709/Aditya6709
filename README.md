- **Tech Stack:**  
  - **Backend:** Python, Resume Parsing with libraries like **PyPDF2** and **spaCy**   
  - **Storage:** **Supabase** bucket to store resumes in organized folders.  
  - **Deployment:** Deployed on **Streamlit** for easy accessibility.  

- **Challenges Solved:**  
  - Efficiently extracting and analyzing data from various resume formats (PDF, Docx).  
  - Implemented a scoring algorithm to weigh skills, certifications, and projects dynamically.  
  - Ensured domain-specific customization by allowing flexibility in skill weighting.  

- **Future Improvements:**  
  - Incorporate NLP-based semantic analysis to enhance keyword matching and ranking accuracy.  
  - Add support for generating domain-specific feedback for candidates.  
  - Enable multi-language support for international resumes.  

- **Impact:**  
  Significantly reduces the time and effort required in the initial screening of candidates, helping organizations focus on top talent quickly and efficiently.  

- **Live Demo:**
